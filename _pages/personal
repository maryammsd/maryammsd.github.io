## Training and Voluntary Experience
* **[Mental Health First Aid](https://www.mhfa.com.au/) (MHFA), [Mental Health  Association](https://www.mhahk.org.hk/), Hong Kong, 2024.**<br>
To prepare myself to assist individuals experiencing mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression, I completed training at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and obtained my Mental Health First Aid certificate.

I served as a peer companion with Counselling and Wellness center in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. To promote mental wellness and provide a supportive environment to fellow students, we organized several activities, one-on-one conversation with students at JUSTalk cafe, story telling sessions, and [Zentangle](https://zentangle.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooJTNyNr5EDFMNsGkt8KIUDHsDP249P1iINLpCpPNqffBdagGzi) art sessions.
