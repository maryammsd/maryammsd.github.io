I am currently a dual-degree PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the Sharif University of Technology, supervised by [Professor Charles Zhang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~charlesz/) and [Dr. Morteza Amini](https://sharif.edu/~amini/). Currently, my research is about using program analysis for crash reproduction in Android applications. I am eager to automate the process of triggering a crash under vast GUI event space in Android apps, given as little information as having only the crash stack trace. Before that, I received my Master's degree from the Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, in 2016, supervised by Dr. Mehdi Kharrazi. At that time, I focused on analyzing programs at the hypervisor level. In addition, I earned my bachelor's degree from Amirkabir University of Technology in 2014.
